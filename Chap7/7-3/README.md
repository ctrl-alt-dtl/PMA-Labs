# Lab 7-3

## For this lab, we obtained the malicious executable, *Lab07-03.exe* and DLL, *Lab07-03.dll*, prior to executing. This is important to note because the malware might change once it runs. Both files were found int he same directory on the victim machine. If you runt he program, you should ensure that both files are in the same directory on the analysis machine. A visible IP string beginning with `127` (a loopback address) connects to the local machine. (In the real version of this malware, this address connects to a remote machine, but we've set it to connect to localhost to protect you.)
