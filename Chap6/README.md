# Recognizing C Code Constructs in Assembly

The goal of the labs for this chapter is to help you understand the overall functionality of a program by analyzing code constructs. Each lab will guide you through discovering and analyzing a new code construct. Each lab builds on the previous one, thus creating a single, complicated piece of malware with four constructs.
